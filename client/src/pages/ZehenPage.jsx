            <strong>Timeline of the Lohgarh case study:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Day 1 saw a general meet-up of the male population of Lohgarh with Dr. Nandy and team Zehen. (No females were present) which hinted at the patriarchal behavior of the men.</li>
            <li>Day 2 was all about collecting data. Zehen had prepared a questionnaire (bilingual: English and Hindi) which was distributed amongst the residents. Volunteers were assigned to assist them. The sample size was 300.</li>
            <li>The outcome of the survey highly reflected towards substance abuse in young adults, however, this was only seen in males. The second was regarding career indecisiveness and eventually lack of employment opportunities for the youth aged 19 and above.</li>
            <li>Women were mostly homemakers, and there was a serious lack of education. Male dominance and ego played a vital role in the subdued growth of the females.</li>
            <li>There was a significant lack of menstrual hygiene and mental health awareness, to such an extent that they prefer medicines for every trivial thing, whether be it for mental health or menstruation.</li>
            <li>What we found out is that, due to economic conditions and the pressure to earn and sustain a living, the residents there look for quick and easier methods to cure anxiety and depression, since time waits for none, they wouldnâ€™t prefer to go to therapy.</li>
          </ul>
